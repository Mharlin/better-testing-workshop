Palindrome - when a word reads the same forwards and backwards

The generator should not be the same as the implementation

1. create palindrome gen with even and odd number of characters
    should only need one custom gen
2. write specs for checkReverse
    check both positive and negative cases
3. find the bug in checkIndices
    fix the implementation


When importing the project with IntelliJ choose to import it as a BSP project
